Gabriel Paternain - Cambridge (dynamical and geometrical aspects of Hamiltonian systems, in particular magnetic and geodesic flows. His recent research focuses on geometric inverse problems and his collaboration with Mikko Salo and Gunther Uhlmann yielded solutions to several inverse problems in two dimensions, including the tensor tomography problem[2] and the proof of spectral rigidity of an Anosov surface.)
